In HTML, elements can be categorized as either container tags or empty tags based on whether they contain content or not.

#### Container Tags

Container tags, also known as paired tags or start-end tags, are HTML elements that enclose content between an opening tag and a closing tag.

```html
<div>This is a container tag</div>
<p>This is another container tag with text content</p>
```

Container tags have both an opening tag `<tag>` and a closing tag `</tag>`, which surround the content they are applied to. They can contain other HTML elements, including other container tags, forming a hierarchical structure.

#### Empty Tags

Empty tags, also known as self-closing tags or void tags, are HTML elements that do not have any content between an opening tag and a closing tag because they do not enclose content.

```html 
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
<br>
<input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">
```

Empty tags are self-contained and do not require a closing tag. They typically represent standalone elements like images, line breaks, or input fields. They are terminated with a trailing slash `/` before the closing angle bracket `>` or are written as self-closing tags.

Understanding the difference between container and empty tags is essential for properly structuring HTML documents and knowing how to use different types of elements effectively.
