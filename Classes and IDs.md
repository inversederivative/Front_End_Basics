To get this ball rolling, I thought I would introduce some of the things I already somewhat grasp. 

So in front end web programming, the name of the game is html, css, and Javascript. 

As I've been moving towards React, it seems that these three basics are still essential to know!

### HTML Classes and IDs

One of the most crucial ideas in front end web programming is you create these tags in the html code, and you can then add a class or an ID to the tag, so it can be utilized or modified somewhere else. 

### Classes and IDs

#### Classes
Classes are used to apply styles to multiple elements without repeating the same styles. They are defined using the `class` attribute.

```html
<div class="container">
  <p class="highlight">This is a highlighted paragraph.</p>
  <p>This paragraph has no special styling.</p>
</div>
```

#### IDs

IDs are used to uniquely identify an element on a page. They are defined using the id attribute.

```html
<div id="header">
  <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
</div>
```

### CSS Styling with Classes and IDs

#### Selecting Classes

To style elements with a specific class, prefix the class name with a dot (.) in CSS.

```css
.container {
  width: 80%;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

#### Selecting IDs

To style elements with a specific ID, prefix the ID name with a hash (#) in CSS.

```css
#header {
  background-color: #333;
  color: white;
  padding: 10px;
 }
```

This markdown snippet provides a clear overview of how to use classes and IDs in HTML and CSS, along with examples demonstrating their usage.
