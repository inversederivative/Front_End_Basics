In HTML, tags can be categorized as either semantic or non-semantic based on whether they convey meaning about the content they enclose.

#### Semantic Tags

Semantic tags are HTML elements that carry meaning and convey the purpose or role of the content they enclose. They provide context and clarity to both human readers and search engines, making the structure of the document more understandable.

```html
<header>This is a semantic header tag</header>
<nav>This is a semantic navigation tag</nav>
<article>This is a semantic article tag</article>
<aside>This is a semantic aside tag</aside>
<footer>This is a semantic footer tag</footer>
```

Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` describe the type of content they contain, making it easier to understand the document's structure and hierarchy.

#### Non-Semantic Tags

Non-semantic tags, on the other hand, do not inherently convey any meaning about the content they enclose. They are typically used for styling purposes or generic layout structuring.

```html
<div>This is a non-semantic div tag</div>
<span>This is a non-semantic span tag</span>
<div class="sidebar">This is another non-semantic div tag used as a sidebar</div>
```

Non-semantic tags like `<div>` and `<span>` are versatile and can be used for grouping content or applying CSS styles, but they do not provide any information about the content's role or purpose within the document.
