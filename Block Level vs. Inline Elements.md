In HTML, elements can be categorized as either block-level or inline based on how they are displayed and interact with surrounding elements.

#### Block-Level Elements

Block-level elements always start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them, pushing subsequent elements onto a new line. They create significant structural divisions in a webpage's content.

```html
<div>This is a block-level element</div>
<p>This is another block-level element</p>
```

Block-level elements are typically used for large-scale components like paragraphs, headings, lists, and structural elements like `<div>` and `<section>`.

#### Inline Elements

Inline elements, on the other hand, do not start on a new line. They only occupy the width necessary to contain their content, allowing other elements to sit beside them on the same line.

```html
<span>This is an inline element</span> <span>and this is another inline element</span>
```

Inline elements are often used for smaller-scale elements like links `<a>`, emphasis `<em>` or `<strong>`, and span `<span>` elements used for styling purposes.

Understanding the distinction between block-level and inline elements is crucial for controlling the layout and structure of a webpage's content effectively.
